<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Crowds-Jupyter-Notebook


Crowds was a project I worked on for my senior design project at Drexel. The mission was to create a Dynamic Couponing system for restaurants and bars based off of how 'crowded' the establishment was. It was going to utilize computer vision cameras to identify individuals entering and leaving the restaurant/bar and use machine learning to process the bulk data and create prescriptive analytics on what sort of deals should be deployed during off-peak hours. Needless to say, the project was very budget and manpower intensive which was hard enough as a full-time student. Some of these concepts and the mission overall have been carried over to my current venture [Phoodie](https://phoodie.io) but on a much more focused level. I started over, re-built everything from the ground so I feel comfortable sharing this deprecated project with any brave GitHub Surfers.

This repo is the Jupyter Notebook to create price prediction for restaurants/bars for project. It was made to demonstrate prices at different time periods for restaurants based on crowd density.
